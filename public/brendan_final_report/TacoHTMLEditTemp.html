<h1>(4) Evaluation of Project</h1>
<p>
The final outputs were realtively closely alligned to those we set out to acheive initially. The website manages to perform the primary functions of searching, reviewing and delivering a profile space for users. The final outputs, however, do fall slightly short of expectation however, not meeting all the invisaged goal.
</p>
<p>
The most obvious function lacking from the final output is the ability to review businesses. It most certainly allows users to rate businesses on a simple scale of one-to-five, but does not allow the user to provide a thorough, or for that matter brief, analysis of their experience with the business. This, I feel, is a crucial aspect to the quality expectations of the user, and may result in a somewhat pointless experience for the user, discouraging them from using the site again.
</p>
<p>
A key reason for the inability to complete this primary goal, mostly revolves around time management and technical difficulties. Due to a continual uphill battle with both our hosting provider, DreamHost, and a lack of experience with Ruby on Rails, aspects of the site too longer to develop than others. We would often find ourselves restoring and reuploading content to the server because it had lost in a technical glitch the day before hand.
</p>
<p>
Initially we do not view this missing functionality as being a major issue, instead looking at how much time we had spent on it, and taking a 'that will do' approach. Having let it sit for a while though, and taking a more objective look, its easy to see that if we had to pick between developing the one-to-five star rating system again, or just developing a comments only system, we would have chosen the later. Whilst having a comments based application may have made it more time consuming for the user to find the desired content, the resulting experience would have been more meaningful, and hence a better outcome for expectation management.
</p>
<p>
I also feel that the final page structure and interface design fell short of expectations, in terms of general usability and clarity. The initial intention at the design phase was to make the core functions of the service feel distinct, separate and easy to move between. During the production phase however, much of this was lost, resulting in experience that often repeats itself, leaves the user lost and ultimately portrays a poor level of quality.
</p>
<p>
Much of this can, again, be attributed to both tehnical and time management related issues. By the time we finally managed to have the core functions operating adequately, from our perspective at the time, much hesitation existed toward changing or editing anything within the application.
</p>
<p>
As a result of not being able to meet these relatively small, but ultimately important expectations, I feel we have failed in some part at reaching no just our user goals, but also personal and project ones. The expectations of how the site would exist at the final output were indisputeably lesser than those established during the design phase of the project. This means that we can pinpoint the problems with the project to exist primarily at the production phase. At some point between setting our goals, work schedule, designing the project and then the final evaluation, there is has been a failure, off sorts, which most probably could have been avaoided.
</p>
<p>
I feel that communication may have been the biggest problem during the production phase, as this is the primary difference between the design and evaluation phase. Having chosen to seperate the project up into backend and frontend with Tim taking the first and I taking the later, meant that the perceived need for communication at the time was reduced. With us both di
