<h1>(2) Design Process</h1>
<p>
With our Project Plan established, and, therefore, our goals outlined, we set about <a href="">sketching out</a> the outputs necessary to meet these outcomes. Understanding the pressures of a tight time schedule, we began by identifying the core functions of the outputs, and selecting those outputs that would most efficiently meet the bulk of our user, personal and project goals.
</p>
<p>
In terms of structure, we identified three main functions we would like the system to be able to perform for the user by the deadline of our project; search for a business, rate a business and a personalised profile function. These three functions would deliver the core user expectations of our project, whilst enabling us to have plenty of time to test, and rectify problems identified during the production phase of the project.
</p>
It was also decided that at this point to break down workload between Tim and myself, assigning tasks based on each others known strengths, weaknesses and interests. As Tim had done the bulk of the scripting on the studio four project, and had key interest in this area, it seemed appropriate that he focus on development of the back end of the system; where the web site would interact with the database. Myself, having key interest in layout and interface design, decided to focus on the front end of the site; graphic and web layout design.
