<h1>(3) Production Process</h1>
<p>
Having now identified the outputs required via the design process, we set about developing the project.</p><p>
For the back-end, Tim elected to used Ruby on Rails combined with a MySQL database. He had a number of problems, with rails proving increasingly unreliable on the server we were using.
<p>
The production of the front began with the consideration of colours, style and layout. Being a website which had to engage, and hold users for an extended period of time, the design had to convey the intended image of being exciting and 'new'. The selection of a colour-scheme based around green therefore seemed appropriate.
</p>
<p>
A logo and overall style for the website needed to be produced. The choice of a slightly playful, but professional sans-serif typeface was made for the fresh and modern visual cues it carried. A speech bubble was then incorporated into the logo, signifying the word-of-mouth cliche mynewfavourite.biz was modelled from. This speech bubble graphic was then used a number of times throughout the site, providing a linking theme between the header and content. Using photoshop, all graphical elements for the site were created, sliced and then exported.
</p>
<p>
The layout was then generated from hand using external css stylesheets. Content was written shortly after, with the objective of making the website as self explanatory as possible.</p>
