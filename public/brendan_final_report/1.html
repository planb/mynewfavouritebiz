<h1>(1) Goals Set</h1>
<p>
There were a number of goals set and outlined in the original <a href="documents/projectplan.pdf">project plan</a>; specifically outcomes that would be beneficial to us, our project and the users of our project. The idea had for the project had come about from a few negative personal experiences relating to trusting businesses I had never used before. After repeated trips to the mechanic for maintenance on my car, and then break downs, I quickly realised that I was not getting what I paid for. As a result, I thought it would be good if there were a source I could have contacted, to determine what was the best mechanic in the area, and avoid that negative experience in the first place. The idea remained dormant for a while, until presented with an open slather on what we could do for our final studio project.
</p>
<p>
Consequently, there were many outcomes that I wanted to achieve (personally), these included:</p><p>
Develop a web application from start to finish<br>
Develop and understanding of online social communities<br>
Develop a greater understanding of CSS, web standards, structure, coding practices and design elements.<br>
Networking / Collaborating with real world people
</p>
<p>
There were many outcomes that we wished to achieve for the business, these include:</p><p>
Develop a respected business that people know they can trust to provide informed information about businesses in the Brisbane region.<br>
Develop a social community that actively participates in rating and reviewing businesses in the Brisbane region.
</p>
<p>
There were many outcomes that we wanted MyNewFavourite.Biz to achieve for its users, these include:</p><p>
Provide users with a means to make an informed decisions about businesses they wish to use.<br>
Provide users with a means to rate and review a businesses performance so that other users can make an informed decision.
