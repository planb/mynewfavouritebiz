<h2>Production Process</h2>
<h3>Working Application</h3>
<p>This is where the bulk of the development took place, I would love to reiterate the entire production process but I have already talked about it in-depth over at <a href="http://timandbrendansstudio6.blogspot.com" title="Development Blog">our blog</a>, so head on over there and get up-to-date.</p>
<p>This is where about 60% of my learning came from - here I learnt how to code in Ruby, write SQL, learn console commands, play with a server, create / edit / delete domains, users and databases. Although this was really hard and time consuming I throughly enjoyed it (in a weird way) and wouldn&#39;t hesitate in doing it all over again. I learnt so much about different coding techniques (DRY and MVC for example), structuring XHTML and code and writing complex joins in SQL - I really enjoyed the entire learning process.</p>
<h3>Deployment</h3>
<p>This should have been the most exciting time for us - our application was fully completed all we need to do now is upload it and that is it! But alas no - if only it was that easy... I bought hosting with a company called <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com" title="Dreamhost">Dreamhost</a> who were crazy cheap with crazy bandwidth and they said they supported Ruby on Rails - woohoo! I googled around a bit for tutorials on deploying a app on Dreamhost and came up with a lot of hate mail saying that <abbr title="Dreamhost">DH</abbr> is a pain in the ass to deploy on - it is possible but stay away if you have the cash (which I did not)... So with no other option I read the 15 tutorials on how to deploy the bugger, spent countless hours reading the production.log file and after two days of swearing finally got it working. I was having some unusual errors so there was not a lot of support on forums and the likes.</p>
<p>But it is up and running now and that is all that matters. Again this is just one of the great experiences that I have had whilst developing this application - I really do know now what is involved in creating something from start to finish.</p>
<h3>Issues</h3>
<p>Issues are just things that you have to deal with I have found out - they come and go but they are <strong>always</strong> there. These are just some of the issues that I had to get my head around while coding for <abbr title="MyNewFavourite.Biz">mnf.b</abbr>:<ul>
	<li>Deployment</li>
	<li>Hosting</li>
	<li>Databases</li>
	<li>Database Users / Permissions</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Upon reflecting on these issues that I had to figure out solutions for, it has become evident that no project is going to be without them. I think I came into this project thinking the hardest part was going to be learning a new language - I wasn&#39;t aware that all these other issues existed. I am glad that I came across them though - from what I hear I will be encountering them from now until forever.</p>
