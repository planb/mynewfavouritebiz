<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<h3>Studio Brief</h3>
<p>Once again we were presented with a <a href="http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/~mmds3802/" title="Studio 6">studio</a> subject - but this semesters was a tad unique. We were basically given free reign over what we wanted to create as long as it drew on elements of our degree over the 3 years <strong>and</strong> it must be presented at the end of year exhibit.  Many students chose to do portfolios (as means of self advertising), some created web sites for clients and others t-shirt designs - but Brendan and myself wanted to create something that we had a need for.</p>
<h3>Our Idea and Inspiration</h3>
<p>Ever been after a mechanic and been undecided on what business to use? Ever been after a hairdresser but you do not know the quality of the hairdressers? These are just some of the problems that we face in our daily lives - so we decided to change that. We wanted to create an online social business rating application which gave people the power to choose what businesses they use based on other peoples ratings and reviews.</p>
<h3>Project Goals</h3>
<p>We broke our goals down into a few sub headings: goals for us, goals for the site and goals for our user base.</p>
<h4>Goals For Us</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Develop a web application from start to finish</li>
	<li>Develop an understanding of online social communities</li>
	<li>Develop a greater understanding of CSS, web standards, structure, coding practices and design elements</li>
	<li>Networking and collaborating with real world people</li>
	<li>Learning a new coding language (<a href="http://rubyonrails.com" title="Ruby on Rails">Ruby on Rails</a>)</li>
	<li>Most importantly: build something that we can be proud of</li>
</ul>
<h4>Goals For The Site</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Develop a respected business that people know they can trust to provide informed information about businesses in the Brisbane area</li>
	<li>Develop a social community that actively participates in rating and reviewing businesses in the Brisbane area</li>
</ul>
<h4>Goals For Our User Base</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Provide people with a means to make an informed decision about a business they wish to use</li>
	<li>Provide people with a means to rate and review businesses performance so that other people can make an informed decision</li>
</ul>
<p>They were the goals that we set for ourselves at the start of the semester and it is my belief that we did in fact accomplish majority of them. Some goals such as developing a respected business is something that is extremely intangible - it is not something that we can reach out and say &ldquo;yes we are now respected&rdquo; - it is something that we have to earn and the way that we will earn it is by being in the business for years.</p>
<p>But I believe that (as I will explain later on in the report) that I know have much greater understanding of design elements, coding practices, structure, social communities and networking and it has all come from working on this one project.</p>
