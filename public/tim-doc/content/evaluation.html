<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<h3>Final Product</h3>
<p>I don&#39;t think that it is possible that I will ever be entirely happy with something that I create. There is always <em>something</em> missing or wrong - its just the way it is. But with that said I am throughly happy with what we have accomplished with just one semesters worth of work! Sure there is still a hell of a lot to do (proper admin section, filtering process of user comments and businesses added, usability and accessibility issues and general site maintenance) but now we have a barebones working application that we can further develop.</p>
<p>And that is exactly what we intend to do - further develop the idea in our spare time. I would like to see it take a different direction by specializing in a particular business type because I feel that covering (or having the ability to cover) every business in Brisbane will mean over-simplifying the categorizing process. If we focus on just one particular type or category then we have the ability to dig right in deep and focus on the aspects that matter to that particular business type.</p>
<p>Brendan on the other hand is much more focused on keeping it extremely broad by encompassing each and every business that gets added to the site. I like to entertain this idea (although above I have just stated that I would like to change direction) because I feel that it is a real possibility if we could get the <a href="http://www.yellowpages.com.au" title="Australian Yellow Pages">Yellow Pages</a> onboard and integrate their listings with ours. So it would be a kind of hybrid site that not only listed every business in Brisbane but you were also able to rate and review them. I feel that this could really quickly extend our (and the yellow pages) user base and ability to be trusted as a source of informed information.</p>
<p>These are two of the possibilities that I am entertaining for the future of <abbr title="MyNewFavourite.Biz">mnf.b</abbr> at the moment.</p>
<p>The final product just doesn&#39;t encompass what you can see, it is also made up of everything that you cannot see - for example the code, site structure and hosting. These three elements played an important role in determining what the final outcomes of the site would be (both design and inner workings). Firstly the code - the application is coded in <a href="http://rubyonrails.com" title="Ruby on Rails">Ruby on Rails</a> (reasonings have been mentioned before) and this did and didn&#39;t help. Ruby was (still is) a new coding language to me so it took a lot of getting used to. I loved that it was fully <abbr title="Object Orientated">OO</abbr> and that was the main selling point (that and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern" title="Active Record">Active Record</a>). But some of the hardest things with Rails are the easiest with other languages like PHP - and this was a huge problem for us. Deploying the application with our host (<a href="http://www.dreamhost.com" title="Dreamhost">Dreamhost</a>) was an absolute nightmare - what should be a 5 minute upload and configure process ended up taking me two full days to complete. But thankfully, once it was up and running it wasn&#39;t too bad. I am sure that had I been more knowledgeable in deploying rails applications the process would have been a lot smoother and hassle free - but I wasn&#39;t and I paid the consequences - it was for the better though, now I can do it in 5 minutes. Lastly is the website structure - <abbr title="MyNewFavourite.Biz">mnf.b</abbr> is fully XHTML 1.0 Strict valid and that is thanks to me, who painstakingly sat there and error checked each and every page! We did this to ensure that each and every user of the internet will be able to have some form of interaction with the website wether they are using a screen reader or FireFox 2.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are a few concerns regarding the final product. Although our final outputs are what we originally desired in the planning stages (searching and rating) there is something missing from the project which I believe is key to creating the experience that we are wanting to promote - the ability to review businesses. This has come about due to a few coding issues that I had where I just could not get the rating to play nicely with the comment system - they just seemed to be very anti each other. And as a result the end user is missing out on a major part of the experience, possibly so much so that the application is not providing the service that they were expecting.</p>
<p>When Brendan and I talked this over we dismissed it as something that we can just add later - it&#39;s no big deal. But now, looking back we should have put more effort into making it work because it is going to add to the user experience (one of our key goals).</p>
<p>To sum it up - I am extremely happy with what we have accomplished in such a short period of time even though there are some critical aspects missing. I believe that, although missing the comment system (which will only heighten the user experience) that the solid framework that we have developed is a great starting block for us to expand upon.</p>
<h3>Exhibition</h3>
<p>Unfortunately I was disappointed with the end of year exhibition - I was under the impression that there were going to be more industry people there. I know that it can be argued that maybe no one liked our idea enough to approach us and query us but from observing the room and talking with lots of people it was the general consensus that there wasn&#39;t much of a turn out. A lot of the crowd was made up of former students and students friends and relatives. And I am aware that this is by no means a fault of the university&#39;s (lecturers and tutors) - but it is just a shame that the industry was not available to come and check us all out, after all the hard work that each and every student put into creating their end of year / end of university project.</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong> a big thanks to Lorna for setting it up and organizing the entire thing - although the industry turn out was poor I still had a fantastic time drinking beer and eating food. Totally aside from the lack of industry people I found the night enjoyable and so did everyone I talked to (including my parents who attended) - I didn&#39;t mind explaining our project to all the parents in the room - majority of them said that <abbr title="MyNewFavourite.Biz">mnf.b</abbr> would be something that they would actually use which is a pretty exciting possibility for us. Although the night was disappointing in one respect I had a great time and would be more than willing to do it over again.</p>
<p>Something to consider though, if another one of these presentation nights were to be held again (maybe this suggestion is obsolete now that the course has been moved from Ipswich to St Lucia?) the location could be change to somewhere local to majority of the industry. I have a feeling that the location of the event was the main deterrent and had the event been located in Brisbane somewhere (maybe at a tafe or uni in a lecture room) there would have been more of a showing.</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Studio is over, university is over - now we are all cast out into the big bad world to find career jobs so that we can buy fancy cars, big homes and ski at least 180 days a year! I believe that through the studio courses and this this degree I have been given a distinct advantage over a lot of other graduating students and I am grateful - thanks.</p>
