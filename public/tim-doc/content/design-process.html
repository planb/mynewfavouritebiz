<h2>Design Process</h2>
<h3>Initial Planning Stage</h3>
<p>This was the most crucial stage in the entire life cycle of this application and was something that we glossed over to start with unfortunately. It took me two goes just trying to build an app without any real direction before I went back to the drawing board and worked out what we needed and how it was all going to interact. That is a mistake that I will only make once and you would think after 5 studio assignments and countless other coding assignments I would have figured this out earlier but for whatever reason I jumped straight into the code because I thought I had the idea in my head. If there is one significant aspect to the creation of <em>any</em> piece of work it is the initial planning stage!</p>
<p>After sitting down for a 10 minutes I finally had some kind interactions mapped / what we actually want the app to do, and we came up with <a href="http://timandbrendansstudio6.blogspot.com/2007/08/production-phases.html" title="Inital Planning Design">this</a>. And this was our end goal - this is the application we wanted to present for the end of semester exhibit. And as you can see (by the <a href="http://mynewfavourite.biz" title="MyNewFavourite.Biz">final product</a>) that is exactly what we accomplished and more.</p>
<h3>Work Plan</h3>
<p>In the first report we handed in (Project Plan) we outlined a kind of work plan that we wanted to follow and that we believed was suitable. I think it was a little after the first week that I sat there looking at my monitor through the 500 lines of code or so and went &ldquo;yeah... sure - we so haven&#39;t given enough time to different things - this assignment is far beyond my power to finish...&rdquo; and at that stage it was. I was bogged down just trying to write the simplest of statements and nothing was working for me. So I decided then and there that maybe we could do only a semi working admin section and cut out the user testing - maybe then we would have a chance.</p>
<p>And unfortunately that is what ended up happening - it is something that both of use did not want to do - but in order to get a working application some things needed to be dropped for the moment. Now that we are without time restrictions we fully plan to go back and fully user test in the hope that it raises new and exciting ideas and fixes some issues that we cannot see.</p>
<h3>Downloading and Installing</h3>
<p>Lucky for us everything that we needed (development wise) was open source - so it was just a matter of downloading and install for us to get under way. For me this was a very awkward process, I have never really played around in Terminal (command line) much and setting things like environment variables and paths is far out of my league. And guess what? There is no simple package install for Rails, the best and easiest way is to command line it - lucky for me there was an <a href="http://hivelogic.com/narrative/articles/ruby-rails-mongrel-mysql-osx" title="Dan Benjamin: Building Ruby, Rails, Subversion, Mongrel and MySQL on Mac OS X">excellent tutorial online</a> which lead me through installing, ruby, rails, subversion, mongrel and mysql on mac os x - and it went A OK. I would have loved to get around to learning and using subversion but just did not have the time - it is something that I will look at in my life after university.</p>
<p>This whole experience was a great learning process and really got my feet wet which was extremely handy considering that I now use it almost on a daily basis to navigate around my computer editing config files and opening files (woot). Double bonus is that rails uses a lot of command line commands to launch the built in server (weBRICK or mongrel), migrate databases and just about anything else you can think of.</p>
<h3>A Few Simple Applications</h3>
<p>This was the week of trial of an error - getting my feet wet and then drowning myself. Because I had never used most of the things I downloaded (I had heard of them and played with only some of them) I thought it might be wise to create some sample applications so I can find out how it all works. I created a sample blog with a comments system and a to-do list. I found maybe the best site in the world on rails over at <a href="http://railscasts.com" title="Ryan Bates: Railscasts">Ryan Bates: Railscasts</a> - it has heaps and heaps of programming video casts where he sits you down and walks you through a particular concept. This site was instrumental to the development of our site.</p>
<p>If it wasn&#39;t for creating these sample applications I do not think that it would have been possible to create MyNewFavourite.Biz - I would have just been lost.</p>
