			<h2>About MyNewFavourite.Biz</h2>
			<p>MyNewFavourite.Biz is an online social business rating application designed to give the public a chance to read ratings and reviews about a business before they use it.</p>
			<p>People are able to log into the site and add businesses and rate and review exiting businesses.</p>
			<p>For more information please go to our development blog located at <a href="http://timandbrendansstudio6.blogspot.com" title="Development Blog">http://timandbrendansstudio6.blogspot.com</a>.</p>
			
			<h2>Project Goals</h2>
			<h3>Studio Brief</h3>
			<p>Once again we were presented with a <a href="http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/~mmds3802/" title="Studio 6">studio</a> subject - but this semesters was a tad unique. We were basically given free reign over what we wanted to create as long as it drew on elements of our degree over the 3 years <strong>and</strong> it must be presented at the end of year exhibit.  Many students chose to do portfolios (as means of self advertising), some created web sites for clients and others t-shirt designs - but Brendan and myself wanted to create something that we had a need for.</p>
			<h3>Our Idea and Inspiration</h3>
			<p>Ever been after a mechanic and been undecided on what business to use? Ever been after a hairdresser but you do not know the quality of the hairdressers? These are just some of the problems that we face in our daily lives - so we decided to change that. We wanted to create an online social business rating application which gave people the power to choose what businesses they use based on other peoples ratings and reviews.</p>
			<h3>Project Goals</h3>
			<p>We broke our goals down into a few sub headings: goals for us, goals for the site and goals for our user base.</p>
			<h4>Goals For Us</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Develop a web application from start to finish</li>
				<li>Develop an understanding of online social communities</li>
				<li>Develop a greater understanding of CSS, web standards, structure, coding practices and design elements</li>
				<li>Networking and collaborating with real world people</li>
				<li>Learning a new coding language (<a href="http://rubyonrails.com" title="Ruby on Rails">Ruby on Rails</a>)</li>
				<li>Most importantly: build something that we can be proud of</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Goals For The Site</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Develop a respected business that people know they can trust to provide informed information about businesses in the Brisbane area</li>
				<li>Develop a social community that actively participates in rating and reviewing businesses in the Brisbane area</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Goals For Our User Base</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Provide people with a means to make an informed decision about a business they wish to use</li>
				<li>Provide people with a means to rate and review businesses performance so that other people can make an informed decision</li>
			</ul>
			<p>They were the goals that we set for ourselves at the start of the semester and it is my belief that we did in fact accomplish majority of them. Some goals such as developing a respected business is something that is extremely intangible - it is not something that we can reach out and say &ldquo;yes we are now respected&rdquo; - it is something that we have to earn and the way that we will earn it is by being in the business for years.</p>
			<p>But I believe that (as I will explain later on in the report) that I know have much greater understanding of design elements, coding practices, structure, social communities and networking and it has all come from working on this one project.</p>
			
			<h2>Design Process</h2>
			<h3>Initial Planning Stage</h3>
			<p>This was the most crucial stage in the entire life cycle of this application and was something that we glossed over to start with unfortunately. It took me two goes just trying to build an app without any real direction before I went back to the drawing board and worked out what we needed and how it was all going to interact. That is a mistake that I will only make once and you would think after 5 studio assignments and countless other coding assignments I would have figured this out earlier but for whatever reason I jumped straight into the code because I thought I had the idea in my head. If there is one significant aspect to the creation of <em>any</em> piece of work it is the initial planning stage!</p>
			<p>After sitting down for a 10 minutes I finally had some kind interactions mapped / what we actually want the app to do, and we came up with <a href="http://timandbrendansstudio6.blogspot.com/2007/08/production-phases.html" title="Inital Planning Design">this</a>. And this was our end goal - this is the application we wanted to present for the end of semester exhibit. And as you can see (by the <a href="http://mynewfavourite.biz" title="MyNewFavourite.Biz">final product</a>) that is exactly what we accomplished and more.</p>
			<h3>Work Plan</h3>
			<p>In the first report we handed in (Project Plan) we outlined a kind of work plan that we wanted to follow and that we believed was suitable. I think it was a little after the first week that I sat there looking at my monitor through the 500 lines of code or so and went &ldquo;yeah... sure - we so haven&#39;t given enough time to different things - this assignment is far beyond my power to finish...&rdquo; and at that stage it was. I was bogged down just trying to write the simplest of statements and nothing was working for me. So I decided then and there that maybe we could do only a semi working admin section and cut out the user testing - maybe then we would have a chance.</p>
			<p>And unfortunately that is what ended up happening - it is something that both of use did not want to do - but in order to get a working application some things needed to be dropped for the moment. Now that we are without time restrictions we fully plan to go back and fully user test in the hope that it raises new and exciting ideas and fixes some issues that we cannot see.</p>
			<h3>Downloading and Installing</h3>
			<p>Lucky for us everything that we needed (development wise) was open source - so it was just a matter of downloading and install for us to get under way. For me this was a very awkward process, I have never really played around in Terminal (command line) much and setting things like environment variables and paths is far out of my league. And guess what? There is no simple package install for Rails, the best and easiest way is to command line it - lucky for me there was an <a href="http://hivelogic.com/narrative/articles/ruby-rails-mongrel-mysql-osx" title="Dan Benjamin: Building Ruby, Rails, Subversion, Mongrel and MySQL on Mac OS X">excellent tutorial online</a> which lead me through installing, ruby, rails, subversion, mongrel and mysql on mac os x - and it went A OK. I would have loved to get around to learning and using subversion but just did not have the time - it is something that I will look at in my life after university.</p>
			<p>This whole experience was a great learning process and really got my feet wet which was extremely handy considering that I now use it almost on a daily basis to navigate around my computer editing config files and opening files (woot). Double bonus is that rails uses a lot of command line commands to launch the built in server (weBRICK or mongrel), migrate databases and just about anything else you can think of.</p>
			<h3>A Few Simple Applications</h3>
			<p>This was the week of trial of an error - getting my feet wet and then drowning myself. Because I had never used most of the things I downloaded (I had heard of them and played with only some of them) I thought it might be wise to create some sample applications so I can find out how it all works. I created a sample blog with a comments system and a to-do list. I found maybe the best site in the world on rails over at <a href="http://railscasts.com" title="Ryan Bates: Railscasts">Ryan Bates: Railscasts</a> - it has heaps and heaps of programming video casts where he sits you down and walks you through a particular concept. This site was instrumental to the development of our site.</p>
			<p>If it wasn&#39;t for creating these sample applications I do not think that it would have been possible to create MyNewFavourite.Biz - I would have just been lost.</p>
			
			<h2>Production Process</h2>
			<h3>Working Application</h3>
			<p>This is where the bulk of the development took place, I would love to reiterate the entire production process but I have already talked about it in-depth over at <a href="http://timandbrendansstudio6.blogspot.com" title="Development Blog">our blog</a>, so head on over there and get up-to-date.</p>
			<p>This is where about 60% of my learning came from - here I learnt how to code in Ruby, write SQL, learn console commands, play with a server, create / edit / delete domains, users and databases. Although this was really hard and time consuming I throughly enjoyed it (in a weird way) and wouldn&#39;t hesitate in doing it all over again. I learnt so much about different coding techniques (DRY and MVC for example), structuring XHTML and code and writing complex joins in SQL - I really enjoyed the entire learning process.</p>
			<h3>Deployment</h3>
			<p>This should have been the most exciting time for us - our application was fully completed all we need to do now is upload it and that is it! But alas no - if only it was that easy... I bought hosting with a company called <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com" title="Dreamhost">Dreamhost</a> who were crazy cheap with crazy bandwidth and they said they supported Ruby on Rails - woohoo! I googled around a bit for tutorials on deploying a app on Dreamhost and came up with a lot of hate mail saying that <abbr title="Dreamhost">DH</abbr> is a pain in the ass to deploy on - it is possible but stay away if you have the cash (which I did not)... So with no other option I read the 15 tutorials on how to deploy the bugger, spent countless hours reading the production.log file and after two days of swearing finally got it working. I was having some unusual errors so there was not a lot of support on forums and the likes.</p>
			<p>But it is up and running now and that is all that matters. Again this is just one of the great experiences that I have had whilst developing this application - I really do know now what is involved in creating something from start to finish.</p>
			<h3>Issues</h3>
			<p>Issues are just things that you have to deal with I have found out - they come and go but they are <strong>always</strong> there. These are just some of the issues that I had to get my head around while coding for <abbr title="MyNewFavourite.Biz">mnf.b</abbr>:<ul>
				<li>Deployment</li>
				<li>Hosting</li>
				<li>Databases</li>
				<li>Database Users / Permissions</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>Upon reflecting on these issues that I had to figure out solutions for, it has become evident that no project is going to be without them. I think I came into this project thinking the hardest part was going to be learning a new language - I wasn&#39;t aware that all these other issues existed. I am glad that I came across them though - from what I hear I will be encountering them from now until forever.</p>
			
			<h2>Evaluation</h2>
			<h3>Final Product</h3>
			<p>I don&#39;t think that it is possible that I will ever be entirely happy with something that I create. There is always <em>something</em> missing or wrong - its just the way it is. But with that said I am throughly happy with what we have accomplished with just one semesters worth of work! Sure there is still a hell of a lot to do (proper admin section, filtering process of user comments and businesses added, usability and accessibility issues and general site maintenance) but now we have a barebones working application that we can further develop.</p>
			<p>And that is exactly what we intend to do - further develop the idea in our spare time. I would like to see it take a different direction by specializing in a particular business type because I feel that covering (or having the ability to cover) every business in Brisbane will mean over-simplifying the categorizing process. If we focus on just one particular type or category then we have the ability to dig right in deep and focus on the aspects that matter to that particular business type.</p>
			<p>Brendan on the other hand is much more focused on keeping it extremely broad by encompassing each and every business that gets added to the site. I like to entertain this idea (although above I have just stated that I would like to change direction) because I feel that it is a real possibility if we could get the <a href="http://www.yellowpages.com.au" title="Australian Yellow Pages">Yellow Pages</a> onboard and integrate their listings with ours. So it would be a kind of hybrid site that not only listed every business in Brisbane but you were also able to rate and review them. I feel that this could really quickly extend our (and the yellow pages) user base and ability to be trusted as a source of informed information.</p>
			<p>These are two of the possibilities that I am entertaining for the future of <abbr title="MyNewFavourite.Biz">mnf.b</abbr> at the moment.</p>
			<p>The final product just doesn&#39;t encompass what you can see, it is also made up of everything that you cannot see - for example the code, site structure and hosting. These three elements played an important role in determining what the final outcomes of the site would be (both design and inner workings). Firstly the code - the application is coded in <a href="http://rubyonrails.com" title="Ruby on Rails">Ruby on Rails</a> (reasonings have been mentioned before) and this did and didn&#39;t help. Ruby was (still is) a new coding language to me so it took a lot of getting used to. I loved that it was fully <abbr title="Object Orientated">OO</abbr> and that was the main selling point (that and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern" title="Active Record">Active Record</a>). But some of the hardest things with Rails are the easiest with other languages like PHP - and this was a huge problem for us. Deploying the application with our host (<a href="http://www.dreamhost.com" title="Dreamhost">Dreamhost</a>) was an absolute nightmare - what should be a 5 minute upload and configure process ended up taking me two full days to complete. But thankfully, once it was up and running it wasn&#39;t too bad. I am sure that had I been more knowledgeable in deploying rails applications the process would have been a lot smoother and hassle free - but I wasn&#39;t and I paid the consequences - it was for the better though, now I can do it in 5 minutes. Lastly is the website structure - <abbr title="MyNewFavourite.Biz">mnf.b</abbr> is fully XHTML 1.0 Strict valid and that is thanks to me, who painstakingly sat there and error checked each and every page! We did this to ensure that each and every user of the internet will be able to have some form of interaction with the website wether they are using a screen reader or FireFox 2.</p>
			<p>To sum it up - I am extremely happy with what we have accomplished in such a short period of time.</p>
			<h3>Exhibition</h3>
			<p>Unfortunately I was disappointed with the end of year exhibition - I was under the impression that there were going to be more industry people there. I know that it can be argued that maybe no one liked our idea enough to approach us and query us but from observing the room and talking with lots of people it was the general consensus that there wasn&#39;t much of a turn out. A lot of the crowd was made up of former students and students friends and relatives. And I am aware that this is by no means a fault of the university&#39;s (lecturers and tutors) - but it is just a shame that the industry was not available to come and check us all out, after all the hard work that each and every student put into creating their end of year / end of university project.</p>
			<p><strong>BUT</strong> a big thanks to Lorna for setting it up and organizing the entire thing - although the industry turn out was poor I still had a fantastic time drinking beer and eating food. Totally aside from the lack of industry people I found the night enjoyable and so did everyone I talked to (including my parents who attended) - I didn&#39;t mind explaining our project to all the parents in the room - majority of them said that <abbr title="MyNewFavourite.Biz">mnf.b</abbr> would be something that they would actually use which is a pretty exciting possibility for us. Although the night was disappointing in one respect I had a great time and would be more than willing to do it over again.</p>
			<p>Something to consider though, if another one of these presentation nights were to be held again (maybe this suggestion is obsolete now that the course has been moved from Ipswich to St Lucia?) the location could be change to somewhere local to majority of the industry. I have a feeling that the location of the event was the main deterrent and had the event been located in Brisbane somewhere (maybe at a tafe or uni in a lecture room) there would have been more of a showing.</p>
			<p>All in all - thanks for the great night.</p>
			<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
			<p>Studio is over, university is over - now we are all cast out into the big bad world to find career jobs so that we can buy fancy cars, big homes and ski at least 180 days a year! I believe that through the studio courses and this this degree I have been given a distinct advantage over a lot of other graduating students and I am grateful - thanks to everyone who has has had a hand in my degree over the last 3 years, it has been great. So long and thanks for all the fish!</p>
